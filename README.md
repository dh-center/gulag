# Gulag history

## Build
RECOMMENDED NODE.JS VERSION: 10.
1. Maybe you will need to install `node-gyp` (`npm install -g node-gyp`) for `node-sass` compiling.
2. Run `npm install` in the project root directory.
3. Run `gulp`. You need `gulp-cli` package to be installed.
Build result will be stored in `dist` directory.
